### Using `cffconvert` as a Google Cloud Function

`cffconvert` comes with [an interface](../src/cffconvert/gcloud/gcloud.py) for
running as a Google Cloud Function.

Really, all the Google Cloud interface does is get any supplied URL
parameters, and use them as if they had been entered as command line
arguments.

On Google Cloud Function, set `requirements.txt` to:

```text
cffconvert[gcloud]
```

and use the following as `main.py`:

```python
from cffconvert.gcloud.gcloud import cffconvert

def main(request):
   return cffconvert(request)
```

### Docker

Build the Docker container 

```shell
cd <project root>
docker build --tag cffconvert:3.0.0a0 .
docker build --tag cffconvert:latest .
```

Run the Docker container 

```shell
cd <where your CITATION.cff is>
docker run --rm -ti -v ${PWD}:/app cffconvert
```
