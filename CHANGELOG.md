# 3.0.0 (Unreleased)

## CLI

1. Long outputs, for example those resulting from validation errors, are now truncated by default, but this behavior can be disabled using `--verbose` flag [https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/278](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/278)

1. Added "Star on GitHub" footnote in CLI

## Library

1. Added conversion and validation behavior for CFF 1.3

1. `entity` authors get exported as `Organization` when converting to `schema.org` or `codemeta` (was `Person`) [https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/239](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/239)
1. CFF key `name` takes precedence over `alias` when converting entity authors (was the other way around) [https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/308](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/308)
1. `schema.org` and `codemeta` conversion export an affiliation name as `name` (was `legalName`) [https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/272](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/272)
1. Added `"upload_type": "software"` when exporting to Zenodo from CFF files that use schema versions 1.0.x or 1.1.x [https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/306](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/306)
1. Apalike conversion now uses "and" or ", and" to concatenate author names when there are 2 or more authors [https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/226](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/226)
1. Bibtex conversion now uses braces to protect names of entity authors [https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/156](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/156)

## Library

- added APA output (PR [#149](https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/pull/149); thanks [@wleoncio](https://github.com/wleoncio))
- added support for validation and conversion of `CITATION.cff` files with `cff-version: 1.2.0`
- simplified the `Citation` class and its interface
- `cli` is no longer part of the public interface of the library
- URLs are now constructed from `identifiers`, `repository`, `repository-artifact`, `repository-code`, or `url`, with a transparent mechanism to choose what to use given the data that is available from a given `CITATION.cff` file
- Authors are now constructed from `given-names`, `family-names` (including `name-particle` and `name-suffix`), `alias`, `name`, `affiliation` and `orcid`, with a transparent mechanism to choose what to use given the data that is available from a given `CITATION.cff` file

## Other

- switched to static configuration (setup.cfg over setup.py)
- dependencies are now in `setup.cfg` as opposed to `requirements[-dev].txt`
- updated version ranges for dependencies
- tests are no longer `unittest.TestCase` based, but pytest with fixtures
- added jsonschema based validation for CITATION.cff files with `cff-version: 1.2.0`
- implemented _State pattern_ for `Citation` to help it deal with multiple behaviors under past and future versions of the Citation File Format.
- switched from TravisCI to GitHub Actions workflows, added linting and publishing workflows
- CI is now testing against Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9 on Mac, Linux and Windows
- copies of the relevant schemas are now bundled with the package 
- organized the tests to be more orthogonal to each other / less overlap between tests

# 1.3.3

    different place than before. This release fixes
    <https://github.com/citation-file-format/cffconvert/issues/119>).

    schema version that implements the spec 1.0.3). This will fix some
    problems with the list of SPDX license abbreviations. These
    additional licenses should now work:
    -   `AGPL-3.0-only`
